# Wind-Resistand-Telescope-Dome
<i>A 3d printed telescope dome that rotates based on the wind direction and wind speed to protect the telescope from harsh winds</i>
<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>This reposotiry hosts the code and the 3d files needed to replicate the project.</p>
<p> The incentive to create this project started as part of the final project for the Robotics course at Leiden University in the Spring of 2023.
  The goal of our system is to simulate a novel idea concerning the automation of the rotation of a telescope dome based on weather conditions.
  Our system focuses on the behaviour of the wind (wind direction & wind speed) and basically adjusts the telescopes observational position based the sensed input
from the two sensor that we use (Wind vane & Anemometer). That input gets processed from the microprossesor (Arduino Uno) who in turn sends the command to the motor (ULN-2003) to rotate the dome. </p>

<h2> Gear used </h2>
The gear that was used can be divided in two main categories, mechanical and electronic

<h3> Electronics </h3>
<p>Below is the list of electronics that were used</p>
  <ul>
    <li> 1x Arduino Uno</li>
    <li>5x KY-003 Hall Effect Sensor </li>
<li>1x ULN2003 Stepper Motor</li>
<li>1x Breadboard</li>
<li>Jumper Wires</li>
<li>Several Magnets</li>
    </ul>
<p> In the section instruction we will talk about how to create the schematic</p>

  <ul>
    <li> 4x M6 allen bolts</li>
    <li>4x M6  End Nuts</li>
    <li>4x M6 Nuts</li>
    <li>Several  M6 Washers</li>
    <li>Hot glue</li>
 </ul>
